# Refactor VBA code and Measuring Code Performance 

## Overview of Project
Our client, is Steve whose parents are interested in investing in green energy stocks.
Steve initally asked for our help in analyzing a handful of green energy stocks, 
but now he wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market for the last few years.  

This project included writting a macro in VBA to summarize the performance of stocks as measured by Starting Price, Ending Price and percent return for each stock(by ticker). 
Through the code, this information is summarizes in an Excel worksheet with formatting to highlight positive and negative return. 
The code that was originally written to analyze the performance of a specific stock was refactored, i.e., rewritten for improvement and efficiency, 
so that Steve can easily and quickly analyze the yearly performance of several stocks.
